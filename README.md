Welcome To Overpowered Mastery!

This mod doesn't follow the vanilla way, instead does whatever it wants.

Want OP weapons? Here you go!
Want extremely powerful tools? Sure!
Want defense like you've never seen in the 'new age' of modding? We have it all!

Enjoy the mod, and it's source code.

We have the wub-ster items, ridiculous swords and bows, including crossbows that shoot snowballs of all things, op shields, and more.

Keep checking here for future updates to the code and more, and contribute if you want.
